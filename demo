# Getting Started with GitHub: A Beginner's Guide

## 1. Introduction

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where developers store, share, and collaborate on code. This guide covers the fundamental workflow: creating a repository, making changes, and submitting those changes via a Pull Request.

## 2. Core Concepts

Before jumping into operations, it is essential to understand the following terms:

*   **Repository (Repo):** Ideally, a project's folder. It contains all project files and the revision history.
*   **Branch:** A parallel version of a repository. It allows you to work freely without affecting the main version.
*   **Commit:** A saved change to a file (or set of files). It acts like a "save point" in a game.
*   **Pull Request (PR):** A method of submitting contributions to a project. It tells others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Repository

The repository is the starting point for any project.

1.  Log in to your GitHub account.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the **+** icon and select **New repository**.
3.  Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `hello-world`).
4.  (Optional) Add a description.
5.  Select **Public**.
6.  Check the box **Add a README file**.
7.  Click **Create repository**.

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Working on a separate branch prevents errors in the main codebase.

1.  Inside your new repository, look for the dropdown menu labeled **main** (top left of the file list).
2.  Type a new branch name into the text box, for example: `my-first-edit`.
3.  Click on **Create branch: my-first-edit from main**.
4.  You are now working on this new branch.

### Step 3: Make and Commit Changes

Now, let's modify a file to simulate working on code.

1.  Click the `README.md` file in the file list.
2.  Click the **Pencil icon** (Edit this file) in the top right corner of the file view.
3.  In the editor, add some text, for example: "This is my first contribution on GitHub."
4.  Scroll down to the **Commit changes** box.
5.  Write a commit message (e.g., "Update README with intro text").
6.  Click the green **Commit changes** button.

### Step 4: Open a Pull Request (PR)

This step proposes your changes to be merged into the main branch.

1.  After committing, you will see a banner saying "my-first-edit had recent pushes." Click the **Compare & pull request** button.
2.  (Alternatively, go to the **Pull requests** tab and click **New pull request**).
3.  Review your changes in the comparison window.
4.  Give your Pull Request a title and a brief description.
5.  Click **Create pull request**.
